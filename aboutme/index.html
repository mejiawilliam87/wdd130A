    <p>Some of the activities my wife and I like to do are: play Basketball, swim, ride our bikes, and travel</p>
    <p>as far as indoor activities we like read, dance, and listen music.</p>
    <p>We have five children, two girls and three boys; the oldest is 26 and the youngest is 22, we are</p>
    <p>grand parent of a wonderful young man who is 10 years old.</p>
    <p>I like all related to computers and even though I do not work in the computer's field, I enjoy playing</p>
    <p>and learning about this field. I have been member of the church for over 20 years.</p>
